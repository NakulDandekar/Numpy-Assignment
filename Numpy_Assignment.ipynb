    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "Homogeneity:All elements in an ndarray have the same data type (e.g., all integers, all floats). This homogeneity allows for efficient storage and processing.\n",
    "Multidimensionality:ndarrays can have any number of dimensions, from 1D (like a list) to 2D (like a matrix) and beyond. The shape of an array is defined by the number of elements along each dimension (e.g., a 3x3 matrix is a 2D array with shape (3, 3)).\n",
    "Efficient Memory Layout:ndarrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, which makes them much more memory-efficient and faster for operations than standard Python lists, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "Slicing and Indexing:ndarrays offer advanced slicing and indexing capabilities, allowing you to access and modify subsets of data efficiently.\n",

    "Python List: Stored as an array of pointers to objects, which is less memory-efficient.\n",
